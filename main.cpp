/*
    A console application that sets the player's gold in Wesnoth 1.14.9 to the value of 555 when run. 
    It makes use of ReadProcessMemory and WriteProcessMemory to achieve this. The address 0x017EED18
    represents the player's base pointer in Wesnoth. Finding the address and offsets are covered in
    https://gamehacking.academy/lesson/13
    
    This program must be run as an administrator.
    
    This code is covered in the lab at https://gamehacking.academy/lesson/15
